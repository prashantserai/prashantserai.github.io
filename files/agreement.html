<b><u>TERMS AND CONDITIONS</b></u>
<br /><br />
This agreement is entered into by and between SKY @ OSU (formerly Yesplus Club) at the Ohio State University on behalf of itself and its affiliates and licensors ("Organization"), and you as user of this website and potential participant in one or more programs of learning administered by or through the Organization (the "program" or "programs").
<br /><br />
I understand that any benefits derived from this program depend upon the extent of my participation. I accept full responsibility for the outcome of taking the program and I willingly agree to follow all instructions and participate fully.
<br /><br />
I will not disclose the content of the program to anyone. I will not attempt to instruct others in the techniques used in the program unless and until I have received the relevant Organization teacher training and have been certified by the Organization to teach this program.
<br /><br />
I acknowledge that I am not authorized to release the contents of any programs or any parts thereof provided to me by the Organization to any third party without the written authorization of the Organization. I confirm that the Organization's techniques and exercises I learn constitute private and confidential information and I will neither (1) share this information with or teach this information to others except with the prior written permission of the Organization, nor (2) practice the techniques and exercises outside of the Organization program environment except as otherwise instructed by my Organization teacher.   I further acknowledge that the contents of Organization programs constitute the intellectual property of the Organization, and that I may be liable under applicable law for any unlawful use, disclosure, copying, modification or creation of derivative works of such contents except as explicitly authorized by the Organization.
<br /><br />
Notwithstanding anything stated to the contrary in the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall apply to any confidential information, program content or technique of Organization which is or subsequently becomes readily available to the public other than by breach by the receiving party of the undertakings in this User Agreement; or is approved for release by written authorization of the Organization.
<br /><br />
I grant unrestricted rights to the Organization to use my image, name, voice and likeness for written, audio and/or visual presentations on behalf of the Organization.  I understand that the written, audio and/or visual presentations may be used in print, broadcast and online promotions to advance the purposes of the Organization around the world. If I wish to withhold or withdraw this grant of rights, I may do so by writing to the Organization at sky@osu.edu.
<br /><br />
This agreement is governed by the laws of US and shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Courts in US. Any failure to enforce any provision of this agreement shall not constitute a waiver thereof or of any other provision hereof.
<br /><br />
The course fee is nonrefundable except when courses are canceled or the dates are rescheduled. Refunds if any may be processed at organizer discretion, that is for requests received prior to the start of a course. Administrative fees amounting to upto 40% of the course fee may be charged for all refund requests that are processed.
<br /><br />
If a participant attends no sessions of the course, the course registration and full course fee can be transferred to another course of the same course type within 60 days after the end of the course originally registered for.  If a participant is unable to finish the course s/he can take another course of the same course type for no additional fee, provided the participant requests to avail the said benefit via email or in writing, before the end of the course originally registered for.
<br /><br />
<b>Waiver of Liability, Assumption of Risk, Indemnity Agreement, and Release</b>
<br /><br />
As a condition for, and in consideration of the right to participate in any way in any program provided by the Organization (as defined above), I, for myself, my personal representatives, assigns, heirs, and next of kin acknowledge and agree as follows:
<br /><br />
The nature of Organization programs requires me to be qualified, in good health, and in proper physical condition to participate in such programs.  If, at any time, I believe or am advised that the conditions of an Organization program may be unsafe for me, I will immediately discontinue further participation.
Organization programs involve risk of personal injury which may be caused by my own actions or inactions, the actions or inactions of others participating in the programs, the conditions in which the programs take place, or the acts or omissions of others, and that there may be other risks or social and economic losses either not known to me or not readily foreseeable at this time ("Risks");<br />
I fully accept and assume all Risks and all responsibility for losses, costs, and damages I may incur as a result of my participation in Organization programs.
<br /><br />
I hereby release, discharge, and covenant not to sue or hold responsible in any manner whatsoever, the Organization, its affiliates, administrators, directors, agents, officers, members, volunteers, and employees, other participants, officials, owners and lessees of premises on which the programs are conducted (the "Released Parties"), from all liability, claims, demands, losses, or damages on my account caused, or alleged to be caused, in whole or in part by the acts, omissions or negligence of any of the Released Parties and I further agree that if, despite this release and waiver of liability, assumption of risk, and indemnity agreement I, or anyone on my behalf, makes a claim against any of the Released Parties, I will indemnify, save, and hold harmless each of them from any litigation expenses, attorney fees, loss, liability, damage, or cost which may be incurred as the result of such claim.
<br /><br />
By selecting the box marked "yes" and agreeing to this Waiver, I acknowledge that I am at least 18 years of age, have carefully read and fully understand this waiver of liability, assumption of risk, indemnity agreement and release, understand that I have given up substantial rights by agreeing to this waiver, have agreed to it freely and without any inducement or assurance of any nature, and intend this to be a complete and unconditional release of all liability to the greatest extent allowed by law and agree that if any portion of this agreement is held to be invalid, the balance, notwithstanding, shall continue in full force and effect.
