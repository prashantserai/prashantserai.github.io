Depression and anxiety are increasingly being reported among university students all across the world. In this workshop, students learn SKY meditation - a scientifically validated technique that has been shown to reduce stress, depression and anxiety significantly. SKY has also been demonstrated to enhance mental focus and improve the quality of sleep. Along with SKY, participants also engage in interactive programs that enhance soft skills, leadership, resilience, and provide opportunities to engage in peer driven service initiatives.

Benefit to Ohio State and how it benefits the organization:

At the university level, students are subjected to academic, emotional and physical stress. Effective stress management is crucial not only for academic success, but also for an enriching university experience. SKY meditation and yoga have been scientifically validated to not only reduce stress, depression and anxiety significantly, but also enhance well being. SKY will benefit OSU students to better manage their stress and have an enriching university experience

Our mission is to create a stress free and happy OSU. This event enables us to introduce SKY meditation to OSU students and in turn forward our organization's mission.

While sharing their experiences about the program and SKY, past participants have said things like: "one of the best experiences of my life", "really impactful", "would recommend to anybody and everybody", "life changing", etc.
